/*Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/

function arrayDiff(a, b) //a, b be the array of each inserted
{
    let  returnArray=[];//array that save the return answer
  
  for (var i=0;i<a.length;i++){
      if(b.indexOf(a[i])<0)// if the b array didn’t include a[I] element, push a[I] into the returnArray.
{
         returnArray.push(a[i]);
         }
    }
  return returnArray;
